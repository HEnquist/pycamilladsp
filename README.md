# pyCamillaDSP
Companion Python library for CamillaDSP.
Works with CamillaDSP version 2.0.0 and up.

Download the library, either by `git clone` or by downloading a zip file of the code. Then unpack the files, go to the folder containing the `setup.py` file and run: 
```sh
pip install .
```
TODO smarter command with pip git
Note that on some systems the command is `pip3` instead of `pip`.

## Dependencies
pyCamillaDSP requires python 3.6 or newer and the package websocket-client.

These are the names of the packages needed:

| Distribution    | python  | websocket-client         |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------------|
| Fedora          | python3 | python3-websocket-client |
| Debian/Raspbian | python3 | python3-websocket        |
| Arch            | python  | python-websocket-client  |
| pip             | -       | websocket_client         |
| Anaconda        | -       | websocket_client         |

### Linux
TODO add something about new pip --break-system-thing
Most linux distributions have Python 3.6 or newer installed by default. Use the normal package manager to install the packages.

### Windows
Use Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. Then use Anaconda Navigator to install `websocket_client`.

### macOS
On macOS use either Anaconda or Homebrew. The Anaconda procedure is the same as for Windows. 

For Homebrew, install Python with `brew install python`, after which you can install the needed packages with pip, `pip3 install websocket_client`.

## Communicating with the CamillaDSP process
This library provides an easy way to communicate with CamillaDSP via a websocket.

Simple example to connect to CamillaDSP to read the version (assuming CamillaDSP is running on the same machine and listening on port 1234):
```python
from camilladsp import CamillaConnection

cdsp = CamillaConnection("127.0.0.1", 1234)
cdsp.connect()
print("Version: {}".format(cdsp.get_version()))
```

### Classes
All communication functionality is provided by the class CamillaConnection. The contructor accepts two arguments: host and port.
```
CamillaConnection(host, port)
```

### Exceptions

The custom exception `CamillaError` is raised when CamillaDSP replies to a command with an error message. The error message is given as the message of the exception.

Different exceptions are raised in different situations. Consider the following example:
```python
from camilladsp import CamillaConnection, CamillaError
cdsp = CamillaConnection("127.0.0.1", 1234)

myconfig = # get a config from somewhere
try:
    cdsp.connect()
    cdsp.validate_config(myconfig)
except ConnectionRefusedError as e:
    print("Can't connect to CamillaDSP, is it running? Error:", e)
except CamillaError as e:
    print("CamillaDSP replied with error:", e)
except IOError as e:
    print("Websocket is not connected:", e)
```
- `ConnectionRefusedError` means that CamillaDSP isn't responding on the given host and port. 
- `CamillaError` means that the command was sent and CamillaDSP replied with an error.
- `IOError` can mean a few things, but the most likely is that the websocket connection was lost. This happens if the CamillaDSP process exits or is restarted. 


## Methods

## Enums

### ProcessingState
- RUNNING: Processing is running.
- PAUSED: Processing is paused.
- INACTIVE: CamillaDSP is inactive, and waiting for a new config to be supplied.
- STARTING: The processing is being set up.
- STALLED: The processing is stalled because the capture device isn't providing any data.

### StopReason
- NONE: Processing hasn't stopped yet. 
- DONE: The capture device reached the end of the stream.
- CAPTUREERROR: The capture device encountered an error.
- PLAYBACKERROR: The playback device encountered an error.
- CAPTUREFORMATCHANGE: The sample format of the capture device changed. 
- PLAYBACKFORMATCHANGE: The sample format of the playback device changed. 

The StopReason enums also carry additional data:
- CAPTUREERROR and PLAYBACKERROR: Carries the error message as a string.
- CAPTUREFORMATCHANGE and PLAYBACKFORMATCHANGE: Carries the estimated new sample rate as an integer. A value of 0 means the new rate is unknown.

The additional data can be accessed by reading the `data` property:
```python
reason = cdsp.get_stop_reason()
if reason == StopReason.CAPTUREERROR:
    error_msg = reason.data
    print(f"Capture failed, error: {error_msg}")
```


# Included examples:

## read_rms
Read the playback signal level continuously and print in the terminal, until stopped by Ctrl+c. 
```sh
python read_rms.py 1234
```

## get_config
Read the configuration and print some parameters. 
```sh
python get_config.py 1234
```

## set_volume
Set the volume control to a new value. First argument is websocket port, second is new volume in dB.
For this to work, CamillaDSP must be running a configuration that has Volume filters in the pipeline for every channel.
```sh
python set_volume.py 1234 -12.3
```

## play_wav
Play a wav file. This example reads a configuration from a file, updates the capture device fto point at a given .wav file, and sends this modified config to CamillaDSP.
Usage example:
```sh
python play_wav.py 1234 /path/to/wavtest.yml /path/to/music.wav
```
